# Pricing-Panel-
This project features a clean and responsive pricing panel built with HTML and CSS. It showcases three distinct pricing plans: Regular, Premium, and Executive. Each plan includes an image, key details such as duration and minimum amount, and a call-to-action button.

## Features
• Three Investment Plans: Each plan is displayed within a distinct section, making it easy to differentiate between the three.

• Plan Details: Information such as the plan's duration and minimum amount required is clearly presented.

• Fund Plan Button: A call-to-action button for each plan allows users to initiate the funding process (this is just a visual feature; no backend functionality is implemented).

## Structure
• HTML: The content is structured within <div> elements and uses <section> for grouping related content.

• CSS: Styling is linked through an external stylesheet (panel.css), which is referenced in the <head> section of the document.

• Images: Each plan is visually represented with an image. The images are referenced from local files (e.g., money7.avif, money6.jpg).

## To Use;
Clone or download the repository.
Open index.html in your web browser.
Review the different investment plans and the associated details.

## Disclaimer
This is a front-end-only project. The buttons and other interactive elements do not have any backend functionality connected. It's a great starting point if you're looking to build a more complex financial or investment-based website.

Happy coding!
